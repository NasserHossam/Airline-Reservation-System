 **Airline Reservation System**  
📌 **Project Overview**

This project is a database-driven **Airline Reservation System** that simulates core airline operations — managing **flights, seats, passengers, and bookings**. It allows airline staff and users to view available flights, make reservations, manage passenger data, and cancel bookings. The system is designed to be clear, structured, and support essential CRUD operations with a relational database backend, enforcing referential integrity and consistency.

---

🧠 **Objectives**
- Store and manage airline flight schedules and details  
- Track seat availability for flights  
- Register and manage passenger records  
- Enable booking, cancellation, and viewing of reservations  
- Use a relational database with strong data integrity

---

📂 **Database / Data Description**
The system uses a relational database (e.g., MySQL) with the following main entities:
- **Flight:** Contains flight schedule and route information.  
- **Seat:** Contains aircraft seat details and identifiers.  
- **Passenger:** Contains passenger personal information.  
- **Flight_Seat Link:** Connects seats to flights and flags availability.  
- **Booking:** Stores reservation records between passengers, flights, and seats.  

Each table uses primary keys, and foreign keys enforce relationships between flights, seats, passengers, and reservations.

⚙️ **System Workflow / Functionality**
1️⃣ **Flight Management**  
- Staff can add, update, or delete flights.  

2️⃣ **Seat Tracking**  
- Seats are assigned to flights and tracked for availability.  

3️⃣ **Passenger Management**  
- Passenger records can be created and updated.  

4️⃣ **Booking Operations**  
- Users can book, cancel, or view existing reservations.
